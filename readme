// to prevent eavesdropping all data/packets from client to server or server to client
// are encrypted and passed through a SSL tunnel that makes data encrypted
// HTTPS (for this a SSL certificate is required, this certificate is generally provided
// by the host provider(trusted party) which indictaes that the site is secure)

// SSL consists of a public key and a private key
// a SSL certificate is installed on client machine
// when visiting a server the public associate/installed on the client machine for that server
// goes to the server and is validated using the private key (which only server has)

// however we can create a custom/selfsigned (our own ceriticate for testing on localhost)
// to generate a SSL Certificate:
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
